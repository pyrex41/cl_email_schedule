**Complexity**: MEDIUM  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Requirements**:
- Point-in-time database backups before processing
- Detailed scheduler run tracking with checksums
- Recovery mechanisms for failed runs
- Audit trail for all changes

**Strategic Implementation Plan**:

```lisp
;; File: src/audit-system.lisp

;; Phase 1: Enhanced Checkpointing
(defun create-enhanced-checkpoint (db run-id contacts-checksum)
  "Create comprehensive checkpoint with validation data"
  (sqlite:execute-non-query db
    "INSERT INTO scheduler_checkpoints 
     (run_timestamp, scheduler_run_id, contacts_checksum, 
      schedules_before_checksum, status) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, 'started')"
    (local-time:now) run-id contacts-checksum 
    (calculate-schedules-checksum db)))

;; Phase 2: Point-in-Time Backup
(defun create-pit-backup (db-path)
  "Create timestamped backup with integrity verification"
  (let ((backup-path (generate-backup-filename db-path)))
    (alexandria:copy-file db-path backup-path)
    (verify-backup-integrity backup-path)
    backup-path))

;; Phase 3: Recovery System
(defun recover-from-checkpoint (db checkpoint-id)
  "Restore system state from a specific checkpoint"
  (let ((checkpoint (get-checkpoint-details db checkpoint-id)))
    (when (checkpoint-valid-p checkpoint)
      (restore-schedules-state db checkpoint))))
```

**Database Extensions Needed**:
```sql
-- Enhanced checkpoint table
ALTER TABLE scheduler_checkpoints ADD COLUMN 
  schedules_before_checksum TEXT,
  error_message TEXT,
  contacts_checksum TEXT;

-- Add backup tracking table
CREATE TABLE backup_history (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  backup_path TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  size_bytes INTEGER,
  integrity_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 days

**Requirements**:
- Memory-efficient processing of large contact datasets
- Chunked processing with configurable batch sizes
- Database cursor usage to avoid memory exhaustion
- Progress tracking and resumability

**Strategic Implementation Plan**:

```lisp
;; File: src/streaming-processor.lisp

;; Phase 1: Memory-Efficient Contact Streaming
(defun stream-contacts-in-batches (db batch-size processor-fn)
  "Stream contacts in batches to avoid memory exhaustion"
  (let ((offset 0)
        (total-processed 0))
    (loop
      (let ((batch (fetch-contacts-batch db offset batch-size)))
        (when (null batch) (return total-processed))
        (funcall processor-fn batch)
        (incf total-processed (length batch))
        (incf offset batch-size)
        (when (zerop (mod total-processed 10000))
          (format t "Processed ~A contacts...~%" total-processed))))))

;; Phase 2: Resumable Processing
(defun process-contacts-resumable (db run-id start-offset)
  "Process contacts with ability to resume from checkpoint"
  (let ((checkpoint (get-last-checkpoint db run-id)))
    (stream-contacts-in-batches 
     db 1000 
     (lambda (batch) 
       (process-contact-batch batch run-id)
       (update-checkpoint db run-id (+ start-offset (length batch)))))))

;; Phase 3: Resource Management
(defun monitor-resource-usage ()
  "Monitor memory and processing resources during streaming"
  (values 
   (sb-ext:get-bytes-consed)  ; Memory usage
   (get-internal-real-time))) ; Processing time
```

**Performance Optimizations Needed**:

**Strategic Implementation Plan**:

```lisp
;; File: src/config-manager.lisp

;; Phase 1: Versioned Configuration Storage
(defun store-config-version (db config-type config-data valid-from)
  "Store a new version of configuration with effective date"
  (sqlite:execute-non-query db
    "INSERT INTO config_versions 
     (config_type, config_data, valid_from, created_at, created_by)
     VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)"
    config-type (json:encode-json-to-string config-data) 
    valid-from (local-time:now) (get-current-user)))

;; Phase 2: Runtime Configuration Loading
(defun load-active-config (db config-type &optional (effective-date (local-time:now)))
  "Load the active configuration for a given type and date"
  (let ((config-row (sqlite:execute-single db
    "SELECT config_data FROM config_versions 
     WHERE config_type = ? AND valid_from <= ? 
     AND (valid_to IS NULL OR valid_to > ?)
     ORDER BY valid_from DESC LIMIT 1"
    config-type effective-date effective-date)))
    (when config-row
      (json:decode-json-from-string config-row))))

;; Phase 3: Configuration Profiles
(defun get-environment-config (environment config-type)
  "Get configuration for specific environment (dev/staging/prod)"
  (merge-configs 
   (load-base-config config-type)
   (load-environment-overrides environment config-type)))
```

**Database Schema Addition**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE config_versions (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  config_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  config_data TEXT NOT NULL,  -- JSON
  valid_from DATETIME NOT NULL,
  valid_to DATETIME,

(defun calculate-post-window-schedule-date (contact)
  "Calculate when to send post-window email based on exclusion rules"
  (let ((window-end (email-scheduler.rules:exclusion-window-end-date contact (local-time:now))))
    (when window-end
      (email-scheduler.date-utils:add-days window-end 1)))) ; Day after window ends

;; Phase 2: Post-Window Email Creation
(defun create-post-window-email (contact skipped-emails)
  "Create post-window email summarizing missed communications"
  (make-instance 'email-scheduler.domain:email-schedule
                 :contact-id (email-scheduler.domain:contact-id contact)
                 :email-type (make-instance 'email-scheduler.domain:post-window-email)
                 :scheduled-date (calculate-post-window-schedule-date contact)
                 :status :pre-scheduled
                 :priority 6  ; Medium priority
                 :metadata (list :skipped-emails skipped-emails
                                :window-type (get-exclusion-window-type contact))))

;; Phase 3: Integration with Main Scheduler
(defun schedule-post-window-emails (contact skipped-schedules)
  "Schedule post-window emails for contacts with skipped communications"
  (when (and skipped-schedules 
             (not (year-round-exclusion-state-p contact)))
    (create-post-window-email contact skipped-schedules)))
```

**Integration Requirements**:
